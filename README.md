Gift-Giver-APP

The purpose of this app is to try to solve the impossible problem of trying to find a gift for your friends. This App will use a Facebook authentication service, allowing you to log in through your facebook. Once in the app, you can enter in any friends name. The application will search through the friends likes on Facebook, and or some other interests on instagram using the Instagram and Facebook public API's. After find some of your friends interests, you will be reccomended products on amazon that corelate to those interests. The amazon products can be sorted and filtered using the Amazon Product Advertising API. Once gifts are found for a friend, say Alex, the gift options presented for Alex will be queried into a database associated with the Alex, so that if you would like to find more gifts for Alex in the future, you can just access the options in the database associated with Alex. The goal for this project is to essentially make it easier to find gifts for your family and friends.
