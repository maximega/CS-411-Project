Finding gifts for people based on other popular/highly rated gifts
	
  Target User: 
  
  Any user looking for a gift without pre-existing ideas.
  
  Product Definition:
  
  This use of our product will help find gift for people who do not know where to start looking for gifts. 

  Product Logic:
  
  As a user with no idea what they are looking for. In this case, they can click a button that says “See what’s popular”. The   app will give options to see what is popular recently, over the past month, year and so on. The app will use the Amazon API   to load said gifts by the specified search criteria. Once a user wants to purchase a gift, they will be redirected to the     amazon website so that they can purchase said gift. The item will then be added to a database associated with the user’s id,   as it will become part of the user’s purchase history. 

  Input: 
  
  a button that allows you to search by popularity 

  Output: 
  
 
  A list of 30 or so amazon products that each have an image and a link associated with it that allows the user to order the     product from amazon's site. The user will also have the option to sort the output by a few different criteria like most       popular products today, over the past week, over the past month, over the past year, etc. 
	
	
  Mock up: 
  
  In this scenario the user clicks the last of the categories on the navigation bar and will redirect you to a page that         reveals gifts that were bought by users. It will also feature a button that will allow you to extend the number of results     shown and allow you to scroll through the options with a scroll bar.
