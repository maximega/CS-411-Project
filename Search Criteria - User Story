Finding gifts for people based on search criteria
	Target User: Any user looking for a gift with specific criteria in mind.

	Our product in this scenario will help users when looking for gifts in specific categories.

The user here is looking for a gift in a specific category, or across a few specific categories. This will just be one of three options when using the app, and it will say something like “search by category”. This will let the user type in a few search criteria such as “Sports movies headphones”, and then the app will use the Amazon API to find good results. Once a user wants to purchase a gift, they will be redirected to the amazon website so that they can purchase said gift. The item will then be added to a database associated with that user’s id, as it will become part of the user’s purchase history. 

Input: a list of words to search by all separated by spaces 

Output: a list of 30 or so amazon products per criteria matching the search criteria inputted. There will also be the same sorting options as the ones provided by Amazon so the user can sort by relevance, price, new, etc. Each product will have a picture and a link to amazon to allow the user to order from amazon’s site.
