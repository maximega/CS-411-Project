Gifts-APP
High level user stories:

1)
  Finding gifts for people based on filtered categories and Facebook ID’s.

  Target User: 
   
  Social media savvy users looking for a gift for an active Facebook member.
	
  Product Definition:
  
  Our product is an application that assists users when looking for gifts for their facebook friends.

  Product Logic:
  
  As a user looking for a gift for a specific person that has a facebook. When they open the app, there will be three options   to choose from. One option will allow you to filter your search by category, as well as “filter using Facebook”. This option   will allow the user to type in the person’s name and select their facebook. Once the facebook is selected, the app will use   Facebook’s Graph API to find user likes. The app will direct the user to a page that lists top results that are related to     each of the person’s facebook likes. If a user has no likes that correlate to possible gifts then the user will be             automatically redirected to the popular gifts user story.  Once a user wants to purchase a gift, they will be redirected to   the amazon website so that they can purchase said gift. The item will then be added to a database associated with that         user’s id, as it will become part of the user’s purchase history. 

  Input: 
  
  The name of the Facebook user you want to buy a gift for.

  Output:
  
  A list of 10 or so amazon products referenced from facebook likes. The user will have the option to expand the list if they   want to see more items for that particular like, with a scroll feature. Each product will have a picture and a link to         amazon webpage. The user will also have the option to X out of a facebook likes to narrow the results. Once purchased, the     item will be added to a database associated with that user’s id, as it will become part of the user’s purchase history. 

	
  Mockup: 
  
  The user will be presented with a navigation bar with 3 options to possibly click. Each option will lead you to a different   user story. For this user story, a user will be led to a page where a blank text field will appear. A user should then enter   the name and the page will show with possible gift ideas for that person.

2)

  Finding gifts for people based on search criteria.

  Target User: 

  Any user looking for a gift with specific criteria in mind.
  
  Product Definition:
  
	This portion will help users find specific gifts through a search query.
  
  Product Logic:
  
  As a user looking for a gift in a specific category, or across a few specific categories. This will be the second option       when using the gift seeking app, and it will state “search by category”. This will let the user type in a few search           criteria such as sports, movies, or headphones, and then the app will use the Amazon API to find good results. If the search   criteria is not valid i.e: shows nothing on Amazon then the user will be prompted to enter another search. Once a user wants   to purchase a gift, they will be redirected to the amazon website so that they can purchase said gift. The item will then be   added to a database associated with that user’s id, as it will become part of the user’s purchase history. 

  Input: 
  
  A list of words to search [separated by spaces] 

  Output: 
  
  A list of 30 or so amazon products per criteria matching the search criteria inputted. There will also be the same sorting     options as the ones provided by Amazon so the user can sort by relevance, price, new, etc. Each product will have a picture   and a link to amazon to allow the user to order from amazon’s site.

  Mockup: 
  
  Corresponding to the first user story, there will be 3 categories and this user story corresponds to the user selecting the   search by category option. It will then show a drop down of popular categories that might work and an additional text field   to enter your own category. If a valid category is entered/chosen then it will reveal a page with gifts corresponding to       that option with an ability to extend the amount of gifts shown and with a scroll bar on the side. 


3)
  Finding gifts for people based on other popular/highly rated gifts
	
  Target User: 
  
  Any user looking for a gift without pre-existing ideas.
  
  Product Definition:
  
  This use of our product will help find gift for people who do not know where to start looking for gifts. 

  Product Logic:
  
  As a user with no idea what they are looking for. In this case, they can click a button that says “See what’s popular”. The   app will give options to see what is popular recently, over the past month, year and so on. The app will use the Amazon API   to load said gifts by the specified search criteria. Once a user wants to purchase a gift, they will be redirected to the     amazon website so that they can purchase said gift. The item will then be added to a database associated with the user’s id,   as it will become part of the user’s purchase history. 

  Input: 
  
  a button that allows you to search by popularity 

  Output: 
  
 
  A list of 30 or so amazon products that each have an image and a link associated with it that allows the user to order the     product from amazon's site. The user will also have the option to sort the output by a few different criteria like most       popular products today, over the past week, over the past month, over the past year, etc. 
	
	
  Mock up: 
  
  In this scenario the user clicks the last of the categories on the navigation bar and will redirect you to a page that         reveals gifts that were bought by users. It will also feature a button that will allow you to extend the number of results     shown and allow you to scroll through the options with a scroll bar.
